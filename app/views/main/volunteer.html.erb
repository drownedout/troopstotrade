				<p>Troops to Trade is a collaborative mission between the National Customs 
				Brokers and Forwarders Association of America Educational Institute (NEI) 
				and the National Defense Transportation Association (NDTA), whose goal is 
				to provide a professional credentialing opportunity to veterans & military 
				personnel that will allow them opportunities for a career in an industry that 
				is growing at an extremely fast pace. We are well aware of the value that a 
				trained and dedicated military veteran can bring to an organization, but we 
				canâ€™t grow the program without your help! We are in need of program 
				championsfrom across the country. If you have the time or interest, please 
				consider volunteering today! Contact nei@ncbfaa.org for more information. </p>
